# Self Guided Exploratory Data Analysis:

Pandas and Matplotlib are expansive libraries with a lot of functionality. A huge part of working with software is being able to figure out how to do things by searching online, reading documentation, and looking at examples. The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to practice these skills, as well as practice using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter to perform data analysis in a more open ended way.

## The Exercise:

Perform an exploratory data analysis on the NYC Housing data. Here are some examples of things you may want to explore:

1. Are there errors in this data? If so, what are they? Can they be corrected?
2. Look for outliers: do any fields have an abnormally large number of outliers?
3. Try making some charts that you haven't already made...
    * [Matplotlib's documentation shows many types of charts](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)
4. Do sales occur uniformly throughout the months covered?
    * What about the days of the week?
5. Are there any especially interesting properties? 
    * Can you do more research outside of this dataset about said properties?
6. Do any fields correlate with each other closely?
7. Are there interesting trends by zip code and/or borough?


Most importantly during this exercise: **Satisfy your own curiosity**! Pose an interesting question about the data then try and answer it.
