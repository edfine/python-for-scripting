# ETL Exercise

Perform a simulated ETL of the NYC housing data. Use your previously completed EDA of the data to decide how to transform the data. However, you should at minimum:

1. Create one new column based on values in one or more other columns.
2. Drop some rows. Missing values are good candidates, so are outliers!
3. Drop some columns, not all the data is useful!
4. Transform at least one column (in the example we did the boroughs... try something else!)
5. Save your transformed data as a CSV.

Remember, this exercise is more about getting used to Pandas and Python than it is about performing a realistic data analysis, so don't get too caught up deciding exactly which transformations to perform. Just go for it!

**A Tip** I suggest starting in a Jupyter notebook where you can more easily confirm the results of your work in an interactive fashion. Then, once you've got the transformations working, pull them into a python script and test that it works as well.
