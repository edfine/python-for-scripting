# Python's Absolute Basics: Collections and Control Flow

This lesson is about Python's constructs for basic collections and control flow. Specifically:

* The `list` type.
* The `dictionary` type.
* The `tuple` type.
* The `for` construct.
* Comprehensions.

## Prerequisite Expectations

* Understanding of variables and operators in Python.

## Learning Objectives

* Students can create, access, and modify lists.
* Students can create, access, and modify dictionaries.
* Students can create and access tuples.
* Students can use `for` loops to iterate through lists and dictionaries.
* Students can use comprehensions to create lists and dictionaries.

## Instructions for Instructors

Work through the first few Python files line by line with the students describing what is happening on each line. Stepping through the code in a debugger can be especially useful. I suggest a visual debugger rather than something like `pdb` since this is material targeting beginners.

At the end of each Python file is a "micro-exercise" which should take students ~1-2 minutes to complete. Do these in class, then ask one or two students to share their solutions.

Finally, let the students work on the exercise alone or in small teams.

## Technology Requirements

* Any version of Python 3

## Pre-reading Material

* None
