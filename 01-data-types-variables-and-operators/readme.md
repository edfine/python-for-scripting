# Python's Absolute Basics: Variables, Data Types, and Operators

This lesson is about the absolute basics of Python. Specifically, it is about the fundamental units that make up all Python programs:

* Variables, for storing data.
* The different types of data that can be stored.
* And operators, for combining different pieces of data.

## Prerequisite Expectations

* None.

## Learning Objectives

* Students can define a variable.
    * As in "use Python to create variables and a value to them."
    * Also as in "can describe in human language what a variable is in Python."
* Students can explain why Python has multiple different "data types."
* Students can use the `type` built-in to identify what type of data is being used for any particular value in Python.
* Students can combine values in using Python operators.

## Instructions for Instructors

Work through the first few Python files line by line with the students describing what is happening on each line. Stepping through the code in a debugger can be especially useful. I suggest a visual debugger rather than something like `pdb` since this is material targeting beginners.

At the end of each Python file is a "micro-exercise" which should take students ~1-2 minutes to complete. Do these in class, then ask one or two students to share their solutions.

Finally, let the students work on the exercise alone or in small teams.
