# Python's Absolute Basics: Collections and Control Flow

This lesson is about Python's constructs for basic collections and control flow. Specifically:

* The `if/elif/else` construct.
* The `while` loop construct.

## Prerequisite Expectations

* Understanding of variables and operators in Python.

## Learning Objectives

* Students can us the `if/elif/else` construct to selectively execute blocks of code.
* Students can `while` loops to iterate until a condition is met.

## Instructions for Instructors

Work through the first few Python files line by line with the students describing what is happening on each line. Stepping through the code in a debugger can be especially useful. I suggest a visual debugger rather than something like `pdb` since this is material targeting beginners.

At the end of each Python file is a "micro-exercise" which should take students ~1-2 minutes to complete. Do these in class, then ask one or two students to share their solutions.

Finally, let the students work on the exercise alone or in small teams.

## Technology Requirements

* Any version of Python 3
