# Making Web Requests

A huge portion of modern computer systems rely on the internet. Programs regularly access websites, APIs, or other network connected services. In this section we'll use our own Python programs to access and manipulate data from the internet.

Although Python does have a built in library for managing web requests ([`urllib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html#module-urllib)), it's a bit low level and unwieldy. In this lesson we'll use the well-loved and ubiquitous [requests library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).
