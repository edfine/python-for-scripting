# Python Functions

This lesson introduces perhaps the most important construct in all of programming: the function.

## Prerequisite Expectations

* Understanding of datatypes, variables, and operators in Python.
* Understanding of other control flow mechanisms in Python (if, for, while) in Python.
* Understanding of basic collections (list, dictionary) in Python.

## Learning Objectives

* Students can define functions in Python.
    * As in, can use the `def` keyword to make functions.
    * Also as in, can describe in human language what a function is.
* Students can describe the difference between positional and keyword arguments.
* Students can define and call functions with positional and keyword arguments.
* Students can use the `return` keyword to return data from functions.
* Students can describe the difference between `local` and `global` scope.
* Students can describe the difference between pass-by-value types and pass-by-reference types.

## Instructions for Instructors

Work through the first few Python files line by line with the students describing what is happening on each line. Stepping through the code in a debugger can be especially useful. I suggest a visual debugger rather than something like `pdb` since this is material targeting beginners.

At the end of each Python file is a "micro-exercise" which should take students ~1-2 minutes to complete. Do these in class, then ask one or two students to share their solutions.

Then, challenge the students to work individually on the "reading code" exercises, one by one. I like to "work the clock" on this exercise: show the code, set a 5 minute timer, then prompt the students to share their answers or questions on each one. Repeat for each exercise. You may not wish to do all 5, so make a judgement call based on the time available to you.

Finally, let the students work on the final exercise where they'll implement a class, either alone or in small teams.

## Technology Requirements
