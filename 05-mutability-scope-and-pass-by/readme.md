# Python's Absolute Basics: Scope and Passing Data

## Prerequisite Expectations

* Understanding of data types and variables in Python
* Understanding of function definition and use in Python.

## Learning Objectives

* Students can define scope, and identify which scope a variable belongs to.
* Students can identify the different kinds of scope in Python.
* Students can distinguish between mutable and immutable types in Python.
* Students can describe the impact of scope and mutability when calling functions.

## Instructions for Instructors

Work through the first few Python files line by line with the students describing what is happening on each line. Stepping through the code in a debugger can be especially useful. I suggest a visual debugger rather than something like `pdb` since this is material targeting beginners.

At the end of each Python file is a "micro-exercise" which should take students ~1-2 minutes to complete. Do these in class, then ask one or two students to share their solutions.

Finally, let the students work on the exercise alone or in small teams.

## Technology Requirements

* Any version of Python 3
