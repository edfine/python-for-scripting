# Exercise: Working With Files and Text

For this exercise, you'll need to read the file `romeo-and-juliet-no-header-footer.txt` in the books-text folder.

## The exercise:

Write code that can compute the following facts about the play:

* For each character:
    * How many distinct times they speak.
    * How many lines they have.
    * How often they say each word.

> Hint: Use a regex to detect the start of a speaking line. Then, read line by line so you can easily track this context!

> Double hint: It's pretty hard to get this all EXACTLY right. Solve the main problem before moving on to edge cases.

Heads up: This is harder than it sounds...
