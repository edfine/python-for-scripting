# Try Something Else...

With the remaining class time, you're going to be challenged to apply what you've learned in a more self guided way. This doesn't mean you're being thrown into the deep end. On the contrary, the instructor is here to support you, answer questions, and help you make progress.

However, the point of this section of the class is three fold:

1. It is a chance for you to explore something that you actually care about, rather than a topic selected for you.
2. It is a chance to practice in a realistic way. Most of the time when you want to use code for something, you'll be figuring things out on your own.
3. People progress at different rates through a fast paced class like this one. Some of you are probably ready to tackle bigger projects, and some probably want more time to go back and practice to the stuff from day one!

Here are a few suggestions for possible exploration during this time:

0. Finish any of the exercises you weren't able to complete in the allotted class time. Even if you've seen the solution, writing the code yourself will definitely help solidify the concepts.

1. Make a slightly more difficult text-based game: tic-tac-toe is a good choice. Some fun/challenging parts of this:
    * Modeling the board as some kind of data.
    * Trying to design an AI that plays well.
    * Working with user input.

2. Connect Python to a SQL database. Best parts:
    * Super realistic.
    * Get real data from your real database, then use Python/Pandas/Jupyter to manipulate and explore that data.

3. Solve puzzles on CodeWars. Best parts:
    * Fun and bitesized challenges that help you practice the basics.
    * Challenges that get harder slowly.
    * Quick feedback loop, the examples are well tested so you can more easily identify what is wrong with your code.

4. Make a web scraper.
    * Super realistic, a LOT of data is collected this way in real life.
    * More practice working with text data... love it or hate it, processing text is very common!

5. Automate something for your job or personal life.
    * Any number of things can be automated with a Python script...
    * Automate a deployment workflow
    * Generate a report automatically from files or web requests
    * ...

8. Make a command line tool to help you do some common task.
    * Learn to use the wonderful `argparse` library ([https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html))

7. Propose something else!
    * Now that you've seen Python in action, maybe you have an idea of a program you'd like to write. 
    * We're totally open to that!

## Additionally:

1. You may work in groups or alone, whichever you prefer.
2. Whatever you're going to work on, get approval from the instructor beforehand. The instructor will help you not bite off more than you can chew, and they'll also give you some resources to help you get started.
