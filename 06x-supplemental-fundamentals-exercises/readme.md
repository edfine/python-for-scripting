# Supplemental Material

Depending on how much time you (and the students) have, you may wish to give students the opportunity to really practice the fundamentals. The exercises in this section give students a chance to work with more kinds of data, solve some more challenging problems, and generally just practice writing code.

## Note to Instructors

You may wish to go over the use of `assert` with students before assigning this homework. See the `01-assert-basic-testing.py` file for more details.
